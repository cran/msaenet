# msaenet 2.1 (2017-01-15)

## New Features

- Added functions `msaenet.sim.binomial()`, `msaenet.sim.poisson()`, `msaenet.sim.cox()` to generate simulation data for logistic, Poisson, and Cox regression models.
- Added function `msaenet.fn()` for computing the number of false negative selections in msaenet models.
- Added function `msaenet.mse()` for computing mean squared error (MSE).

## Improvements

- Speed improvements in `msaenet.sim.gaussian()` by more vectorization when generating correlation matrices.
- Added parameters `max.iter` and `epsilon` for MCP-net and SCAD-net related functions to have finer control over convergence criterion. By default, `max.iter = 10000` and `epsilon = 1e-4`.

# msaenet 2.0 (2017-01-05)

## New Features

- Added support for adaptive MCP-net. See `?amnet` for details.
- Added support for adaptive SCAD-net. See `?asnet` for details.
- Added support for multi-step adaptive MCP-net (MSAMNet). See `?msamnet` for details.
- Added support for multi-step adaptive SCAD-net (MSASNet). See `?msasnet` for details.
- Added `msaenet.nzv.all()` for displaying the indices of non-zero variables in all adaptive estimation steps.

## Improvements

- More flexible `predict.msaenet` method allowing users to specify prediction type.

# msaenet 1.1 (2016-12-28)

## New Features

- Added method `coef` for extracting model coefficients.
  See `?coef.msaenet` for details.

## Improvements

  with a full set of function documentation and vignettes available.
- Added Windows continuous integration support using AppVeyor.

# msaenet 1.0 (2016-09-20)

## New Features
